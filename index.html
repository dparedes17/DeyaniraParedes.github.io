                <p>The United States Congress is the legislature of the federal government of the United States. It is
                    bicameral, comprising a lower body, the House of Representatives, and an upper body, the Senate. The
                    Congress meets in the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. Both senators and representatives
                    are chosen through direct election, though vacancies in the Senate may be filled by a governor's
                    appointment. Congress has 535 voting members: 100 senators and 435 representatives. The Vice
                    President of the United States has a vote in the Senate only when senators are evenly divided; the
                    House of Representatives has six non-voting members.
                <blockquote>
                    The sitting of a Congress is for a two-year term, at present beginning every other January; the
                    current Congress is the 117th. Elections are held every even-numbered year on Election Day. The
                    members of the House of Representatives are elected for the two-year term of a Congress. The
                    Reapportionment Act of 1929 establishes that they be elected in single-member constituencies or
                    districts by first-past-the-post and that Congressional districts be apportioned to states by
                    population every ten years using the United States Census results, provided that each state has at
                    least one Congressional representative. Each senator is elected at-large in their state for a
                    six-year term, with terms staggered, so every two years approximately one-third of the Senate is up
                    for election. Each state, regardless of population or size, has two senators, so currently, there
                    are 100 senators for the 50 states.
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    Article One of the United States Constitution requires that members of Congress must be at least 25
                    years old (House) or 30 years old (Senate), have been a citizen of the United States for seven
                    (House) or nine (Senate) years, and be an inhabitant of the state which they represent. Members in
                    both chambers may stand for re-election an unlimited number of times.
                </blockquote>
