    <h1>Senators</h1>

        The United States Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress, with the House of Representatives
        being the lower chamber. Together they compose the national bicameral legislature of the United States.

        The composition and powers of the Senate are established by Article One of the United States Constitution. The
        Senate is composed of senators, each of whom represents a single state in its entirety. Each state is equally
        represented by two senators who serve staggered terms of six years. There are currently 100 senators
        representing
        the 50 states. The vice president of the United States serves as presiding officer and president of the Senate
        by
        virtue of that office, and has a vote only if the senators are equally divided. In the vice president's absence,
        the president pro tempore, who is traditionally the senior member of the party holding a majority of seats,
        presides over the Senate.
      <blockquote>
        As the upper chamber of Congress, the Senate has several powers of advice and consent which are unique to it.
        These include the approval of treaties, and the confirmation of Cabinet secretaries, federal judges (including
        Federal Supreme Court justices) flag officers, regulatory officials, ambassadors, other federal executive
        officials and federal uniformed officers. If no candidate receives a majority of electors for vice president,
        the
        duty falls to the Senate to elect one of the top two recipients of electors for that office. The Senate conducts
        trials of those impeached by the House.
      </blockquote>
      The Senate is widely considered both a more deliberative and more prestigious body than the House of
      Representatives due to its longer terms, smaller size, and statewide constituencies, which historically led to a
      more collegial and less partisan atmosphere.
